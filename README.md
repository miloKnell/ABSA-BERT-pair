Code cleaned up and edited to make easier for use. It does ABSA-bert-pair for QA-M on the general catagory only of Sentihood. In the future it will be used for the new dataset Us Political News. For comparisons with Keous. Was originally a colab file and has references to files in drive.

Follow step 2 from the original repo (making the torch model) using their code (https://github.com/HSLCY/ABSA-BERT-pair). You can also use Huggingface transformers.
